        <p>It's not so difficult to learn the Japanese Language. Japanese is considered the toughest language to learn. It is totally different from the English language with a different writing system, grammar structure, and relies heavily on cultural understanding and context. <em>Yes, Japanese is difficult to learn, but not impossible.</em>
          You can acquire a knowledge of Japanese by following these steps. The best ways to learn Japanese and becoming fluent in Japanese are:
          </p>
        <h2>1. Figure out why you want to learn Japanese</h2>
        <p>Are you certain about learning this language? It's important to ask yourself why is you want to learn, without a solid reason, you can get demotivated in the long run, as japanese on average takes longer to learn then most languages. Set your goal and stick to it. Think about why learning Japanese is important for you, whether it is for traveling, for business, or you want to appreciate Japanese culture in a native way. Your reason could be anything, you just have to find something to hold on when you feel like giving up. </p>

        <h2>2. Go with what you know! </h2>
        <p>The good news is that Japanese is not entirely alien to you. The truth is, you already most likely know or can speak Japanese. Don’t believe me? Think about some of the words we use everyday such as Kareoke, Tsunami to car brands like Honda and Toyota, to even simple phrases like Konichiwa and Sayonara and many more. Think about it, you have been saying these words from a long time and you didn’t even realize that you were speaking Japanese! </p>
         <p class="lang-pros">
         Japanese is different from English in that: 
         <ul>
           <li> The language has no gendered words.</li>
           <li>Kanji helps, it represents the English version of the words. Even if you are unaware of how to read Kanji, you’ll have a circumstantial clue for understanding the same word. </li>
            <li>Kana is always read in its original form. No exceptions are there. Once you learn the Kana, you are unlikely to forget their pronunciation.</li>
              <li>The Japanese language contains a lot of loan words. They can be easily spotted as they are mainly written in Katakana. For example, pinku. “Pink”, bi-ru, “beer”, and inta-netto, “internet”, etc.</li>
            </p></ul>
        

            <h2>3. Connect to the Japanese Speaking Community</h2>
            <div class="tip tip-left"><p>HERE'S A TIP: Check out our <a href="community.html">Community Page</a> to learn more about Speech Partners</p></div>
        <p>In order to learn a language to fluentcy it is important to hear how native speakers speak and communicate to them. Therefore you most connect to a Japanese speaking community,It doesn’t matter if your be a part of a online community like ours or not . You just need to find someone with whom you can practice speaking Japanese. Making your speaking ability strong is the most important part of getting fluent in any language.</p>

        <blockquote>Rome wasn't built in a day--Neither was Kanji</blockquote>
          
          <h2>4. Don’t Avoid Kanji and Kana</h2>
        <p>Last but not least, don’t avoid Kanji and Kana, meaning don’t overlook your writing abilities while concentrating on the speaking the language. It can be daunting to know that there are well over 2,000 important Kanji to learn. But on the other hand, Hiragana and Katakana are easy to pick up- mastering them is not a big task. They are just the Japanese alphabets which represent a syllable. Because of the difficulty of the Japanese writing system, it’s relatively hard to properly immerse yourself and remember the pronunciation. Take all the time you need to acquire the basics. It will help you create a stronger foundation for your Japanese learning journey.</p>

        <h2>5. Add Fluidity With Fillers and Connectors</h2>
        <p>Conversational fillers and connectors make our speech sound more fluid and natural. You may not realize it but we use fillers and connectors all the time. Yet, they are often left unnoticed while learning a new language. Phrases like “Actually,” “To be honest,” “Thanks for asking,” “If I'm being frank,” etc. are fundamental conversational connectors. Next time your having a conversation with a native speaker don't be afraid to ask them to teach you some of conversational connectors so that you can buy some time while conversing with a native Japanese speaker. </p>
